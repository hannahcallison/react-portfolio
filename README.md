# React Portfolio

## Introduction

For this project we were given the task of building a portfolio website from scratch using React. The purpose of our portfolio is to showcase our projects and skills to potential employers. With our HTML, Advanced CSS skills and React we were tasked with building a responsive webpage that interacts with the user.
